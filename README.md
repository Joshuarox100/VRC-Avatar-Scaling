Setting Up
--------------
Before following these steps, set up your avatar how you normally would and ensure that you have a basic understanding of how Avatars 3.0 works. If you'd rather follow a video guide for setting this up, go [here](https://youtu.be/7O9MEG3Pico).

1) Download and import the latest **Unity Package** from [**Releases**](https://github.com/Joshuarox100/VRC-Avatar-Scaling/releases) on GitHub **(You will have issues if you don't)**.

</p>

2) In the Avatar Descriptor, assign the included Animators to their corresponding layers.
	>If you already have custom versions of these layers, you can copy the states and parameters from the included Animators into your own [as shown here](https://youtu.be/ejkvgj3CZjU).

</p>

3) Add the following two variables anywhere within your Expression Parameters list (without the quotation marks):
	1. "Scale" (Float): Used for setting the scale of your avatar.
	2. "SizeOp" (Int): Used for knowing when to update the viewpoint.

</p>

4) In the Avatar Descriptor, either use the included Expressions Menu or use it as a submenu within your own.
	>If you're using it as a submenu, make sure not to set 'Scale' or 'SizeOp' to any value when opening the menu or things will break.

</p>

5) If you need to adjust the minimum, maximum, or default scale, adjust the values contained within the 'Size Settings' Animation [as seen here](https://youtu.be/0IDKNUBxxOc).

Everything should now be fully set up! If you have any issues or questions, look in the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) and [questions](#common-questions) section below before [contacting me](#contacting-me).

Common Questions
--------------
**Does this also scale the IPD when you change size?**
>Yes!

**How do I change the animation used when adjusting the scale?**
>By default, any other Animations that are currently playing will continue to play while you change your scale. If you want to make a specific Animation play, use the Action layer to play it when 'SizeOp' is equal to 1.

**How will I look to those who have my Animations disabled?**
>If someone has custom animations turned off, you'll appear to either be floating or partially in the floor at your default size. Your IK will still work correctly though, so don't worry about your arms flying into space or crushing your internal organs when you change size, they won't do that.

Troubleshooting
--------------
**Avatar is smaller or larger than normal when loading in or adjusting scale.**
>This can happen if the default scale of your avatar isn't 1. Fix this by changing the values within the 'Size Settings' Animation to better fit your avatar as shown in the linked video for Step 5 of the tutorial. This can also be caused if you merged the 'Scaling' layer into another Animator and didn't set the 'Scale' and 'RemoteSize' parameters to 0.5.

**Unable to open the 'Size' menu.**
>If you're using 'Scale Menu' as a submenu, ensure sure that selecting it in the previous menu doesn't set 'SizeOp's value.

**The menu doesn't change size when you do.**
>VRChat has already stated that this will be fixed *soon*â„¢. It will update the size when you open one of the main menus like the one for Avatars or Worlds.

**Avatar starts walking weirdly after using Avatar Reset.**
>I don't know why this happens honestly, but it's a known issue that only seems to occur when using local testing. It shouldn't happen for uploaded avatars.

**Viewpoint and Full Body trackers start to drift when changing size (FBT).**
>This seems to currently be an issue with Animator Remeasure Avatar that I don't have control over. A Canny post about this bug has been made by bd_ that you can upvote here: [[BUG] FBT calibration seems to drift when scaling an avatar using Remeasure Avatar](https://feedback.vrchat.com/avatar-30/p/bug-fbt-calibration-seems-to-drift-when-scaling-an-avatar-using-remeasure-avatar)

**Feet either move farther apart or closer together after changing size (Non-FBT).**
>This is actually a problem with using Auto Footsteps. It currently retains the distance between the feet at your starting scale even after using Animator Remeasure Avatar. I've made a Canny post about it that you can upvote here: [[Bug] Auto Footsteps doesn't update correctly after using Remeasure Avatar.](https://feedback.vrchat.com/avatar-30/p/bug-auto-footsteps-doesnt-update-correctly-after-using-remeasure-avatar)
